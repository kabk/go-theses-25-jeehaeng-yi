            Have you ever seen a friend wearing a striped shirt? Have you ever considered how many lines make up the
            stripes or what meaning they might convey? Patterns are deeply embedded in our lives, yet we often
            overlook them without conscious recognition. Although patterns are among the most immediate forms of
            visual art in daily life, they have long been undervalued as mere decorative or incidental elements.
        </p>
        <p>
            This thesis aims to explore the potential of patterns as a visual language that goes beyond their
            ornamental function. By examining the historical and cultural interpretations and uses of patterns, it
            investigates the conceptual dimensions of patterns.

                        Patterns exist on the streets we walk, on the walls we see from bed, on the blankets that
                        cover us, on the clothes we wear, and more. They are so deeply integrated into various
                        aspects of life and the familiar places we often overlook their presence. This research aims
                        to explore patterns that have been intertwined with us for a long time, and discover its own
                        significance.

                        Patterns are essentially repetitions of motifs, and motifs encompass various forms. Some are
                        based on real-life elements such as flowers, leaves, animal skins, etc, while others are
                        abstract, allowing designers to express their subjective perspectives and creative
                        sensibilities. Some patterns are symbolic, taking simplifying or exaggerating forms, —
                        paisley, Seigaiha, Suzani, and etc. However, the same motif can hold completely opposite
                        meanings depending on the era or cultural context. Further examples will follow in the
                        subsequent chapters.

                        In the following two chapters, patterns that I look into are geometric patterns.
                        Geometric patterns refer to designs that use geometric figures — straight lines, curves,
                        circles, triangles, squares, etc. The word 'geometry' is derived from two Greek words,
                        namely γη, gē, which means earth, and μετρον, metron, which means measure.<span class="footnote"

                        A dotted pattern is exactly what it means: a pattern in the form of repeated circular motifs,
                        usually
                        composed on a solid background. It is commonly referred to as POLKA DOT pattern. Polka dots are

                        throughout
                        Europe, by 1844, James K. Polk was campaigning for the U.S. presidency.<span class="footnote"

                        The similarity of names
                        "Polka"
                        and "Polk" piqued the curiosity and soon gained popularity in the United States. The popularity

                        In the early 20th century, polka dots experienced another heyday in the United States. It is
                        because
                        of releasing the song <span class="italic">Polka Dots and Moonbeams</span> by Frank Sinatra and

                        Smallwood, who crowned Miss America in 1926. "You can sign your fashion life away on the
                        polka-dotted line, and you'll never regret it this season," the <span class="italic">Los Angeles

                            <span class="footnote-popup">Weaver, 1940.</span></span> In 1943, The Washington Post
                        featured Jeanne Contini explaining polka dot as: “What we mean by
                        a print with social significance is one that most people can wear most of the time. The whole
                        family
                        of polka dots falls into that category even if they don't spell 'Remember Pearl Harbor' in code.
                        The
                        full-grown variety in particular makes a clean-cut monotone pattern that is neither dizzy nor
                        monotonous. It is as good in a close-up as it is in perspective and manages to be in pleasing
                        proportion to all kinds of figures. It requires no more than a casual acquaintance with the
                        cleaner.”<span class="footnote" tabindex="0"><sup class="footnote-number">7</sup>

                        The repetition of this simple shape became the pattern of American democratic values and an
                        expression of brightness and joy. Perhaps— the dot, the edgeless figure, would have given the
                        viewer
                        a friendly and playful impression, and the repetition of the motif would have formed a sense of
                        rhythm, further enhancing their visual appeal.

                        However, in the Middle Ages of Europe(approximately from the 5th to the late 15th centuries),
                        this
                        pattern had a completely different meaning. Fabrics adorned with dotted patterns were
                        practically
                        considered taboo.<span class="footnote" tabindex="0"><sup class="footnote-number">8</sup>

                        technology of the time, it was not only impossible to print perfect
                        circles but even to arrange them evenly.<span class="footnote" tabindex="0"><sup

                        imperfect circle motifs was
                        reminiscent of the rash of infectious diseases or the bloodstains caused by tuberculosis, which
                        were
                        fatal at the time when medicine was incomplete. Steven Connor, professor of English and cultural
                        historian at the University of Cambridge, explains: “Irregularly spotted fabrics are ominous not
                        just because they are reminiscent of blemishes on the skin, but also because they are
                        uncomfortable
                        reminders of the ominous markings of other fabrics: the blood in the handkerchief that was a
                        traditional sign of tuberculosis, and the 'spotting'... which may presage a miscarriage in early
                        pregnancy. Desdemona's strawberry-spotted handkerchief, which leads to such disasters in
                        Othello,
                        joins together the associations of disease, deception, lust and corruption.”<span

                        What is the first thing that comes to mind when you think of stripes? A national flag? A clown's
                        costume? A crosswalk? Stripes typically refer to a pattern in which parallel lines—horizontal,
                        vertical, or diagonal—are repeated at regular intervals. While commonly found in textiles,
                        particularly in clothing, their striking contrast makes them a powerful visual element used to
                        decorate walls and floors in architectural spaces or serve as design focal points.<span

                                class="footnote-popup">Pastoureau, 2001. pp.80-86</span></span> Stripes are also
                        employed as crucial visual markers in society, such as on crosswalks and traffic signs, where
                        immediate recognition is essential.<span class="footnote" tabindex="0"><sup

                    <p>
                        Art historian Michel Pastoureau, in his book <span class="italic"> Devil's Cloth: A History of
                            Stripes, describes the
                            diverse nature of stripes,</span> categorizing them in “good(signs of celebrations,
                        exoticism,
                        or freedom),
                        diabolic (those by which prisoners in the death camps were ignominiously marked) or dangerous
                        (those
                        used for traffic signs and signals, for example), hygienic (those on sheets and underwear),
                        playful
                        (those used for children's things), athletic (those used for leisure and sports clothes), or
                        emblematic (those on uniforms, insignia, and flags).”<span class="footnote" tabindex="0"><sup

                                pp.4-5</span></span> As such, stripes have carried a wide range of
                        meanings, evolving through history and cultural shifts to play various roles in visual and
                        symbolic
                        communication.

                    <p>
                        In Medieval Europe, while dot motifs symbolized infectious diseases, stripes were used to mark
                        those
                        who were socially excluded. The nineteenth chapter of Leviticus proclaims in verse 19: Veste,
                        quae
                        ex duobus texta est, non indueris—“You will not wear upon yourself a garment that is made of
                        two…”.
                        The exact meaning of duobus remains ambiguous. It is unclear whether this refers to different
                        types
                        of fibers, contrasting colors—possibly implying stripes—or something else entirely. Even among
                        modern scholars, interpretations vary.<span class="footnote" tabindex="0"><sup
                                class="footnote-number-rec">18</sup><span class="footnote-popup">Pastoureau, 2001.
                                pp.7-11</span></span> Medieval biblical commentators and clergy favored the latter
                        interpretation, viewing it as a prohibition against certain forms of decoration or color
                        combinations.<span class="footnote" tabindex="0"><sup class="footnote-number-rec">19</sup><span

                        1295, Pope Boniface VIII officially declared a complete ban on
                        striped monastic garments for all religious orders.<span class="footnote" tabindex="0"><sup

                        The striped uniforms assigned to prisoners not only effectively distinguished them from
                        others—such
                        as non-criminals and prison guards—but also served as a deterrent in cases of escape. Some
                        theories
                        suggest that the horizontal stripes of prison garments, when visually intersected with the
                        vertically aligned prison bars, created a psychological impression of entrapment, reinforcing
                        the

                        The striped uniforms assigned to prisoners not only effectively distinguished them from
                        others—such
                        as non-criminals and prison guards—but also served as a deterrent in cases of escape. Some
                        theories
                        suggest that the horizontal stripes of prison garments, when visually intersected with the
                        vertically aligned prison bars, created a psychological impression of entrapment, reinforcing
                        the

                        Beyond their symbolic meaning, the design of this uniform served practical
                        purposes. The strong contrast of the stripes made it easier to spot sailors who had fallen
                        overboard, and the wide neckline could be used like a flag, allowing conscious sailors to signal

                        Stripes, once emblematic of the lower class, underwent a transformation into a beloved pattern

                        not far from Brittany, Chanel was inspired by the striped workwear seen along the seaside. In
                        1917,
                        she introduced a short shirt inspired by the original Breton shirt into her couture collection.
                        By
                        1930, she even wore a striped knit T-shirt while vacationing, offering a fresh perspective to
                        the
                        influential writers, artists, and celebrities of the time.<span class="footnote"

                        This exposure redefined the perception of
                        stripes—what was once associated with prisoners and low-wage laborers began to symbolize women's
                        liberation.

                    <p>
                        Pastoureau further explains stripes as a pattern of speed and agility.<span class="footnote"

                        is such a dynamic surface structure that it can only be covered at a run. The stripe doesn't
                        wait,
                        doesn't stand still. It is in perpetual motion,(…) endlessly forges ahead, as though driven by
                        the
                        wind.”

                    <p>
                        However, I would like to introduce the stripes that are created with patience and deliberation
                        effort. This is the Écriture series by Park Seo-Bo. In his canvases, stripes do not convey
                        dynamism
                        but rather evoke stillness and deep contemplation. The slight tremors of the artist’s hand as he
                        draws each line, the subtle yet stable contrast of colors—all these elements captivate the
                        viewer,
                        exuding a sense of stable beauty.

                        Stripes, once emblematic of the lower class, underwent a transformation into a beloved pattern

                        not far from Brittany, Chanel was inspired by the striped workwear seen along the seaside. In
                        1917,
                        she introduced a short shirt inspired by the original Breton shirt into her couture collection.
                        By
                        1930, she even wore a striped knit T-shirt while vacationing, offering a fresh perspective to
                        the
                        influential writers, artists, and celebrities of the time.<span class="footnote"

                        This exposure redefined the perception of
                        stripes—what was once associated with prisoners and low-wage laborers began to symbolize women's

                        is such a dynamic surface structure that it can only be covered at a run. The stripe doesn't
                        wait,
                        doesn't stand still. It is in perpetual motion,(…) endlessly forges ahead, as though driven by
                        the
                        wind.”

                        However, I would like to introduce the stripes that are created with patience and deliberation
                        effort. This is the Écriture series by Park Seo-Bo. In his canvases, stripes do not convey
                        dynamism
                        but rather evoke stillness and deep contemplation. The slight tremors of the artist’s hand as he
                        draws each line, the subtle yet stable contrast of colors—all these elements captivate the
                        viewer,
                        exuding a sense of stable beauty.

                        Park Seo-Bo is a pivotal figure in Korean contemporary art and one of the leading artists who
                        spearheaded the Dansaekhwa(단색화) movement. Among his most renowned works is the <span

                        frequently cited as his representative body of work. This is not only because <span

                        significant mark on Korean abstract art but also because it stands as one of the defining works

                        the Dansaekhwa movement.

                        The term Dansaekhwa literally means "monochrome painting," which is why it is often compared to
                        Western monochrome painting. However, in a documentary<span class="footnote" tabindex="0"><sup

                        fundamental distinction between the two. In documentary, he described Western monochrome as a
                        form
                        of minimalist art in which the artist intentionally reduces form and color, using it as a means
                        of
                        expression. In contrast, Dansaekhwa is not about expression but about thought. It does not stem
                        from
                        the artist’s intent to depict something specific but emerges as a result of repetitive actions,
                        through which the artist’s spirit is embedded in the work. This is the fundamental point of
                        divergence between Dansaekhwa and monochrome painting.

                        His stripes were born through the quiet process of emptying his mind. As a result, the stripes
                        on
                        his canvas carry a rhythmic vitality while remaining within the realm of tranquility, never
                        disrupting its stillness. This is because they are imbued with the sincerity of repetitive
                        action
                        and dedicated labor. By eliminating intentionality in color, material, and technique, his
                        canvases
                        embrace simplicity and humility, reflecting the artist’s pure focus and journey of healing.

                        While some work focuses on the artist's own practice, there are works that serve as a language
                        to
                        document the times and actively resisting them. As an example of the latter, I would like to

                        the Pattern and Decoration Movement. Often abbreviated as P&D or referred to as The New

                        non-Western art, including Islamic, Byzantine, Celtic, and Native American art, as well as
                        quilts,
                        carpets, textiles, mosaics, embroidery, lace, and wallpaper, which were considered “technical”

                        between
                        fine art and applied art and tried to blur the boundaries between them. The second is that it
                        provided an alternative perspective on the dominance of North American and European art by
                        incorporating non-Western patterns and traditional craft techniques, thereby questioning the
                        established hierarchy of Western and non-Western art. The last is its connection to feminist

                        Critic Clement Greenberg dismissed decorative aesthetics by equating them with craft, arguing
                        that
                        they were merely mechanical products of labor and technique—superficial, low in quality, and

                        Can patterns be used as a voice without being decontextualized? Amir H. Fallah utilizes
                        traditional
                        patterns to explore complex themes of race and identity. In his paintings, patterns serve as
                        silent
                        markers of identity, replacing conventional forms of representation. In an interview, he stated
                        that
                        physical appearances reveal little about who someone is.<span class="footnote" tabindex="0"><sup

                        Challenging the traditional rules of
                        portraiture—specifically, the depiction of facial features—he instead uses veils printed with
                        intricate patterns as an alternative means of describing and representing individuals. The veils

                        paintings, are directly inspired by Persian miniature painting, Persian carpets, and the

                        everyday life in vivid colors and compositions, reflecting contemporary society. The photograph
                        he

                        Beyond merely reimagining familiar imagery through patterning, he extends this technique by

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        Patterns are one of the most closest art in our life, yet they are often regarded as mere
                        surface-level techniques or purely decorative elements. This study aimed to explore the
                        potential
                        roles and artistic value of patterns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By examining dotted and striped patterns, this study explored how patterns function not merely
                        as
                        decorative elements but as visual codes that acquire meaning within historical and social
                        contexts.
                        Subsequently, I investigated the works from the Pattern and Decoration movement with
                        contemporary
                        artworks. Through this analysis, the study considered how patterns can transcend the boundaries
                        between art and life, serving as a medium for conveying messages. The findings suggest that
                        patterns
                        can function both as a form of artistic expression that encapsulates sensory and spiritual
                        experiences and as a reflection of the visual identity of specific cultures. Furthermore, they
                        offer
                        a way to disrupt the familiarity of the everyday, prompting a re-evaluation of the inherent
                        value
                        embedded within it. Ultimately, patterns are not merely the repetition of motifs but rather
                        structures that construct meaning, serving as a powerful visual language that bridges life and
                        art.
